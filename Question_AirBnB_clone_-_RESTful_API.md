## Tasks
### 0. Restart from scratch!

No no no! We are already too far in the project to restart everything.

But once again, let’s work on a new codebase.

For this project you will fork this codebase:

Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
Update the README.md:
Add yourself as an author of the project
Add new information about your new contribution
Make it better!
If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2
   
### 1. Never fail!

At Holberton, we have a lot of tests, and they all pass! Just for the Intranet itself, there are:

5,213 assertions (as of 08/20/2018)
13,061 assertions (as of 01/25/2021)
The following requirements must be met for your project:

all current tests must pass (don’t delete them…)
add new tests as much as you can (tests are mandatory for some tasks)

    guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 | tail -1
    OK
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
    OK

2. Improve storage
mandatory
Score: 41.67% (Checks completed: 41.67%)
Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods. All changes should be done in the branch storage_get_count:

A method to retrieve one object:

Prototype: def get(self, cls, id):
cls: class
id: string representing the object ID
Returns the object based on the class and its ID, or None if not found
A method to count the number of objects in storage:

Prototype: def count(self, cls=None):
cls: class (optional)
Returns the number of objects in storage matching the given class. If no class is passed, returns the count of all objects in storage.
Don’t forget to add new tests for these 2 methods on each storage engine.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ cat test_get_count.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test .get() and .count() methods
"""
from models import storage
from models.state import State

print("All objects: {}".format(storage.count()))
print("State objects: {}".format(storage.count(State)))

first_state_id = list(storage.all(State).values())[0].id
print("First state: {}".format(storage.get(State, first_state_id)))
